            <h1>Calling all emerging talent: Creative Futures awards competition open for entries</h1>
            <div class="blog-img"><img src="/pic/blog2-img.png" alt="rainbow painting color on the face"></div>            
            <p>The ‘Creative Futures’ awards competition officially launches today, giving students and emerging creative talent the chance to design an omnichannel campaign for leading youth charity YMCA.
                For 178 years, YMCA has supported people through some of the toughest moments in history and today strives to give young people safe spaces to feel secure when they have no one else to turn to. The brief sets out to garner support from a younger audience and encourage online donations, through an omnichannel media mix that includes at least one element of letter box media.<br></p>
            <p>The idea behind this initiative is to highlight the role that print plays in hitting a brief for an omnichannel campaign, and how a clever combination of data, creativity, targeting capabilities and personalization can be utilized to deliver measurable impact for a brand.<br>
            </p>   
            <p>All entries will be judged by a dedicated awards jury including leaders from Canon, YMCA, Nutshell Creative, The Strategic Mailing Partnership, Join the Dots, JICMAIL, Latcham, Marketreach and AutLay – who have also dedicated their time to support in the development of the competition brief and will conduct a series of workshops for shortlisted entrants.<br>
            </p>   
            <p>Judges will be looking for evidence of clear strategic, data-driven thinking combined with creativity and innovation, while aligning to the brand’s core purpose and guidelines. Entrants will be expected to show the customer journey throughout the campaign and include variations of creative copy and messaging to reflect variations in the core target audience demographics based on the objectives.<br>
            </p> 
            <p>All entries must be submitted by November 17. The final winner will be crowned at The Drum Social Purpose Awards on December 8 2022.

            <h1>Rust: is this programming language the future of web development?</h1>
            <div class="blog-img"><img src="/pic/blog1-img.png" alt="programing code shows on the screen"></div>            
            <p>Everyone seems to love Rust (just look at Microsoft's Windows, Azure teams, Linux kernel maintainers, Amazon Web Services, Meta, and Android's open source project). But why? What even is Rust? And why will it be important in 2023?<br>
            </p>
            <p>Rust is a high-performance, statistically-typed programming language designed for safety and performance. It’s one of the most popular programming languages in the tech industry today, with many companies using it to achieve faster performance and ensure their code is memory-safe.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Other languages, such as PHP, are primarily designed for implementing websites. However, Rust is a general-purpose language which can be used in many different places. While with PHP, you are limited to the options available in the PHP interpreter and the web server, in Rust you can do anything if the time is spent implementing it.</p>

            <h1>The company said that the delay is being made in order to allow for a smoother transition to its new Google Analytics 4 system for its business clients.</h1>
            <div class="blog-img"><img src="/pic/blog3-img.png" alt="Google Analytics app on the phone"></div>
            <p>Google Analytics - the tech giant’s website traffic and ad engagement measurement platform – announced today that it’s postponing the sunset date for its Universal Analytics 360 (UA360) platform from October 2023 to July 2024.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Google Analytics 4, the system that will eventually replace both Google’s Universal Analytics (UA) and UA360, is designed to help businesses collect customer data across both web and mobile apps. It was unveiled in October 2020.<br>
            </p>
            <p>In a blog post published this morning, Russel Ketchum, director of project management at Google Analytics, said that the delay in the sunset date is “to allow enterprise customers more time to have a smoother transition to Google Analytics 4” and that, during the interim, the company would be “focusing [its] efforts and investments on Google Analytics 4 to deliver a solution built to adapt to a changing ecosystem.”<br>
            </p>
            <p>Ketchum noted that GA360 “performance will likely degrade” until the new sunset date due to Google gradually shifting its focus to GA4. His blog post also includes a link to a “step-by-step guide” that businesses can use in order to set up GA4.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The company’s decision to transition away from its UA platforms largely stems from an awareness that the world is abandoning the use of third-party cookies. GA4 will use first-party data.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Ketchum’s Thursday blog post also stated that Google’s transition to GA4 will include the introduction of more sophisticated machine learning technology, as well as “custom channel grouping” (which will aggregate cross-channel performance measurements) – both of which are intended to help businesses to more clearly visualize and analyze customer behavior.<br>
            </p>
            <p>How might the delay affect marketers? “The nine-month extension in GA4 migration can’t help but frustrate some Universal Analytics 360 marketing users,” says Eric Schmitt, senior director analyst at Gartner. “Marketing teams who took the deadline at face value and moved aggressively to make the GA4 transition now find their planning, budgeting and resource prioritization assumptions outdated. This is the latest in a pattern by Google of announcing important technical deadlines, and subsequently delaying them – as it has done with cookie deprecation.”</p>

            <h1>GOOGLE STARTS ‘GET THE MESSAGE’ CAMPAIGN PRESSURING APPLE INTO RCS ON THE IPHONE</h1>
            <div class="blog-img"><img src="/pic/blog4-pic.png" alt="google message app picture"></div>
            <p>Google increasingly calling out Apple for not adopting RCS (Rich Communication Services) on the iPhone<br>
            </p>
            <p>In recent months, Google has been pressuring Apple to adopt RCS (Rich Communication Services) on the iPhone. RCS would enhance messaging between Android and iOS users by replacing SMS/MMS.<br> 
            </p>
            <p>RCS (“Rich Communication Services”) is a protocol that allows several vendors, such as ISPs or handset manufacturers, to develop applications that send and receive messages. Many Android phones already have RCS messaging capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>Google contended that Apple’s backing of RCS would prevent some of the issues that arise when Android users text with iPhone users. Currently, images and videos don’t appear as crisp as they might, and text messages can’t be sent over Wi-Fi networks, for example
            </p>
            <p>Google global vice president for integrated marketing for platforms, Adrienne Lofton says it’s awful when Android users are blamed for ruining conversations.
            </p>
            <p>“It’s time to acknowledge that Apple is to blame.” says Lofton
            </p>
            <p>Apple dominates the mobile market with its iOS and Android operating systems, and the latter has 55 percent of the U.S. market, according to StatCounter.
            </p>
            <p>Because users are less likely to switch to another platform or app if all their contacts use the same messaging service, messaging has become a key battleground for tech giants.
            </p>
            <p>Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, says that iMessage is widely used in the United States and thus competes directly with Apple.
            </p>
            <p>“Some legislators are also pushing for fair competition rules that would force competing services to work together, particularly in messaging.” it said
            </p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Hiroshi Lockheimer, a Google senior vice president in charge of Android, cited internal Apple emails that were made public during a lawsuit last year to support his assertion that Apple is using its own text messaging platform to lock in its customers
            </p>
            <p>According to an email in 2013 current Apple senior vice president in charge of software, Craig Federighi wrote “I am concerned iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,”.
            </p>
            <p>iMessage conversations on an iPhone offer a better user experience than SMS conversations. Apple’s functions, such as adding emoji reactions to just one text, hardly function on SMS conversations.
            </p>
            <p>iMessage conversations seem quicker because of Apple’s animations and include things like bubbles that reveal whether someone is typing, as well as group chat administration.
            </p>
            <p>This year, Apple will release new iMessage capabilities, including the ability to unsend or edit messages.

            <h1>AUSTRALIA’S LEADERS ARE CONFIDENT WITH CYBER DISCLOSURE ABILITY, YET HESITANT TO SHARING PUBLICLY</h1>
            <div class="blog-img"><img src="/pic/blog5-pic.png" alt="cyber world"></div>
            <p>In an age of growing transparency, with consumers increasingly concerned about how their data is stored and used, domestic results indicate that Australia is lagging behind its global counterparts, according to local data released today from PwC’s 2023 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey.
            </p>
            <p>The survey examined the views of more than 3,500 CEOs and other C-suite executives globally, including Australia.
            </p>
            <p>Of particular concern were attitudes towards public information sharing and transparency, with 90% of Australian respondents reporting it was a risk that could lead to a loss of competitive advantage, compared to 70% globally. 
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, 81% felt new requirements for mandatory disclosures of cyber incidents to investors or national cyber authorities discourage them from sharing information with law enforcement authorities, compared to 64% globally.
            </p>
            <p>PwC Australia Cybersecurity and Digital Trust Leader Rob Di Pietro said stakeholders are clamouring for more information about how companies manage their cyber risk exposure.
            </p>
            <p>“Regulators want visibility into cyber practices because they want to protect citizens from fraud and loss of privacy, help investors make better decisions and prevent industry or system-wide disruptions. Investors are looking for consistent and comparable disclosures so they can put their money in companies that fit their needs.”
            </p>
            <p>“Cyber incidents can affect shareholder value, temporarily or permanently.”
            </p>
            <p>“As cyber threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, cybersecurity should be seen as a team sport – it should not be siloed within departments or organisations.” 
            </p>
            <p>To build a truly inclusive and holistic cybersecurity culture, entire organisations must be taken on the transformation journey, which the C-suite should lead. Cybersecurity uplift must be expressed as an opportunity, not a burden, and ultimately a vehicle to help organisations achieve their goals.”
            </p>
            <p>Eight-nine per cent of Australian respondents agreed mandatory disclosures of cyber incidents requiring comparable and consistent formats were necessary to gain stakeholder trust and confidence (79% globally). 
            </p>
            <p>In addition, organisations want the government to help set standards, with 90% of respondents stating they expected the government to develop cyber techniques for the private sector, based on the knowledge base built from mandatory disclosures of cyber incidents (75% globally).</p>
