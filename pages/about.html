            <h1>MY <br>VISION IS</h1>
            <p>I have an eye for design and my creativity and attention to detail help bring my vision alive in different art forms and projects. As a photographer I want my images to create a special connection with the viewer, I have a particular interest in the contrast of light and dark and its ability to evoke deep emotions.

            <h3>MY INTEREST</h3>
            <p>I love houseplants. There are probably around 60 house plants in my small apartment ATM. Some of them are cuttings, but most of them are already in mature form. As a plant parent, the most exciting time during the day will be seeing a new leaf coming out in the morning. I guess caring for them and watching them grow and thrive can help me feel satisfaction with minimal effort, especially during the covid lockdown time. </p>    
            <p>I also love photography and painting sometimes. As a graphic designer, it gives me the inspiration to create something that looks "good". </p>
